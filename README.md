# Baryon Painter

The baryon painter is a set of deep generative models (currently a CVAE and CGAN) that maps matter density to pressure. The results are described in [T. Tr√∂ster et al, 2019](https://www.arxiv.org/abs/1903.12173).

# Usage

Both the CVAE and CGAN expose a simple interface, the `paint` method, that takes a dark matter density tile and its redshift as input and generates the corresponding pressure tile:

```python
import baryon_painter.painter

model_path = "trained_models/CVAE/fiducial/"

painter = baryon_painter.painter.CVAEPainter((os.path.join(model_path, "model_state"),
                                              os.path.join(model_path, "model_meta")))
                                             
pressure_tile_generated = painter.paint(input=dm_tile, 
                                        z=redshift_of_tile, 
                                        transform=True, inverse_transform=True)
```
